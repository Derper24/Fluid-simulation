This is just a simple test. I was interested in fluid simulation and, after spending too much time researching physics,
was curious about how I would convert that knowlage into c#. The UI isnt polished, and the gameplay is extremely simple,
but this was a blast to make. I learnt a lot from this project and I'm proud of it. Even if it does look kinda poo poo.
